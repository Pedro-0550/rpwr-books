# Condenser

The condenser uses an external water source to cool down the steam and let it condensate back into water, which gathers in the hotwell. The condenser has several devices:

- 2 CARs (Condenser Air Removal), which are electric pumps which initially lower condenser pressure to allow MSIV to be opened
- 4 SJAE (Steam Jet Air Ejectors), that are used to eject uncondensable gasses from the condenser. Two of them should be always on when steam is available
- 2 Circulation pumps that circulate external water to cool down the steam. The more steam inflow, the higher flow is required. Autocontrol is provided to keep condenser vacuum at desired level (55mbar)
