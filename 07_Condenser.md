# Condenser

The main idea of the condenser is to use an external circulating water circuit to cool down the steam and let it condensate back into water, which gathers in the hotwell. Condenser has several devices:

- 2 CARs - Condenser Air Removal are electric pumps which initially lower condenser pressure to allow MSIV to be opened
- 4 SJAE - Steam Jet Air Ejectors are used to eject uncondensable gasses from the condenser. Two of them should be always on when steam is available
- 2 Circulation pumps - they circulate outside water to cool down the steam. The more steam inflow, the higher circulations is required. Autocontrol is provided to keep condenser vacuum at desired level (55mbar)
