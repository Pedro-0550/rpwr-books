# Basic Interactions

Assuming that you are working fully on manual you should consider following interactions betweens systems:

# Changing reactor power

Raising reactor power will cause primary temperature to raise and will yeld higher steam production. Lowering reactor power will have reverse effect.

# Changing primary flow

Raising primary cooling flow WILL NOT change the temperature in the primary. Instead reactor will react with higher power to more or less maintain the temperature. Therefore:
- RCP flow can be treated as another mean of changing the reactor power (next to rods and boric acid). More flow will cause more power and more steam production.
- In order to reduce primary temperature, after cooling flow is raised, reactivity must be reduced with primary reactor control to stop power raise

# Changing steam demand

Opening turbine valve more, will cause pressure to drop and reactor power to raise to meet higher steam demand. Cooling temperature after initial drop will raise back again.
