# Pressurizer

Pressurizer is a device used to maintain proper pressure in the primary circuit (usually between 10-15 MPa). In order to do so pressurizer is built as a long pipe filled more or less halfway with primary circuit water. Pressurizer heaters will heat this water allowing water to boil and creating steam pressure which affects the whole primary system.
Pressure should be always enough that water never boils in the primary outside of the pressurizer. For that boiling point temperature should always be higher than primary water temperature.

Primary circuit consists of two legs, one for the left part of the reactor, the other one for the right. Pressurizer is located in the left leg. There are several devices in the pressurizer:

- 4 pressurizer heaters designed to heat water in the pressurizer and raise pressure via boiling
- makeup/drain - to change water level in the pressurizer
- 4 relief valves - to dump steam and lower pressure in emergencies
- 2 pressurizer sprays - they spray steam with cold water allowing for it to condensate

Pressurizer is also equipped with a very strong startup heater. As some PWRs can startup solely on decay heat, we have provided the startup heater to make the startup process quicker. It will heat the left leg of the primary circuit.
